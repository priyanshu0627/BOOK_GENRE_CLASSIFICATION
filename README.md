# BOOK_GENRE_CLASSIFICATION
## ABOUT
The aim of the project was to classify a book's genre just by looking at it's cover using deep learning techniques .I have used GOOGLE COLAB as my coding environment.
The total number of genres for the books to be classified into is 5. 
### FastAI provides state of the art results with high computational power. You can use fastai without any installation by using Google Colab. 


## INSTALL
  You don't need to download anything on your system. Just below mention libraries are needed to be installed on your COLAB NOTEBOOK.
- FastAi
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## DATASET
Book covers were taken form [KAGGLE] (https://www.kaggle.com/lukaanicin/book-covers-dataset?select=book-covers) but to since my study was maily focused on FastAi and deep learning i took these 5 genres (to keep this project short).
- Romance
- Childrens-Books
- Sport
- Religion
- Science-Fiction-Fantasy-Horror(all 4 are considered as a single genre in the project)

## RESULT
  The model was able to predict correctly with accuracy of 94.28%.
